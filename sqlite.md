To list all the tables in an SQLite database from the command line, you can follow these steps:

1. Open your terminal or command prompt.

2. Navigate to the directory where your SQLite database file is located or specify the full path to the database file.

3. Run the SQLite shell command and specify the database file:

```bash
sqlite3 your_database_file.sqlite
```

Replace `your_database_file.sqlite` with the actual name of your SQLite database file.

4. Once you're inside the SQLite shell, you can use the `.tables` command to list all the tables in the current database:

```sql
.tables
```

This command will display a list of all the tables in the database, one per line.

Here's an example of what it might look like:

```
table1
table2
table3
```

Each line represents a table name in your SQLite database.

To show all the data from a table in SQLite from the command line, you can use the following steps:

1. Open your terminal or command prompt.

2. Navigate to the directory where your SQLite database file is located or specify the full path to the database file.

3. Run the SQLite shell command and specify the database file:

```bash
sqlite3 your_database_file.sqlite
```

Replace `your_database_file.sqlite` with the actual name of your SQLite database file.

4. Once you're inside the SQLite shell, you can use a SELECT query to retrieve all the data from a specific table. Replace `your_table_name` with the name of the table you want to display:

```sql
SELECT * FROM your_table_name;
```

For example, if you have a table named `employees`, you can retrieve all the data from it with the following command:

```sql
SELECT * FROM employees;
```

This command will display all the rows and columns of data from the specified table.

5. After viewing the data, you can exit the SQLite shell by typing:

```sql
.exit
```

This will return you to the regular command prompt or terminal.

Make sure to replace `your_table_name` with the actual name of the table you want to retrieve data from.

To execute an SQL file in SQLite from the command line, you can follow these steps:

1. Open your terminal or command prompt.

2. Navigate to the directory where your SQLite database file is located or specify the full path to the database file.

3. Run the SQLite shell command and specify the database file:

```bash
sqlite3 your_database_file.sqlite
```

Replace `your_database_file.sqlite` with the actual name of your SQLite database file.

4. Once you're inside the SQLite shell, you can execute an SQL file by using the `.read` command followed by the path to the SQL file you want to execute. For example, if your SQL file is named `script.sql` and it's in the same directory as your database file, you can run:

```sql
.read script.sql
```

Make sure to replace `script.sql` with the actual name of your SQL file.

5. SQLite will execute the commands in the SQL file, and you will see the output and results, if any, in the terminal.

6. After the SQL file has been executed, you can continue interacting with the database or exit the SQLite shell by typing:

```sql
.exit
```

This will return you to the regular command prompt or terminal.

Make sure the SQL file contains valid SQL commands that are compatible with SQLite, and ensure that the file path is correct when using the `.read` command.
